README: Spam Detector Project

##Overview

This project compares two machine learning models — Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier — to detect spam emails using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Library.  

#1. Dataset  
  - Source: UCI Spambase Dataset  
  - Data URL: Spam Data  
  - Target Variable: spam (Binary: 0 = Not Spam, 1 = Spam)  
The dataset contains features related to word frequency and other email properties.    

#Project Steps  

1. Data Retrieval  
  - Data is imported using Pandas.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis   
  - Visualize features vs. target variable using scatter plots.  
  - Calculate correlation coefficients to confirm non-linear relationships.  
3. Data Preprocessing  
  - Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.  
  - Scale the features using StandardScaler.  
4. Modeling  
  - Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification.
  - Random Forest Classifier: A tree-based ensemble model capable of handling non-linear patterns.
5. Evaluation
  - Measure accuracy scores for both models using accuracy_score.
  - Compare performance to assess which model performs better.


#Model Comparison and Results  

  - Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.924
  - Random Forest Classifier Accuracy: 0.956


#Observation:

The Random Forest Classifier outperformed the Logistic Regression model due to its ability to handle non-linearity and feature interactions without manual intervention.

#Dependencies  

The following Python libraries are used:
  - Pandas: Data manipulation
  - Matplotlib: Data visualization
  - Scikit-Learn: Machine learning tools (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and data preprocessing)

Install libraries using:
  - pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

#Files
  - spam_detector.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and analysis.


#How to Run  
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or any Jupyter-compatible environment.
4. Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.


#Conclusion  

The Random Forest Classifier is a better fit for this dataset due to its ability to model non-linear relationships, outperforming Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy.
